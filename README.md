## 👋🏼 Hi, I'm Sam

![Sam Wood - Frontend engineer & banner animation specialist](/assets/github-readme-banner.png)

I'm an experienced UI frontend engineer based in the south of the UK. I've worked on design systems, small and large scale websites, CMSs, digital online display ads and everything in-between (even email templating!). 

I love what I do and I'm always on the open for the next coding opportunity, whether on a permanent, freelance or contract basis!
